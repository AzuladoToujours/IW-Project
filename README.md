# Requirements

Node, MongoDB, npm.

#Install Dependencies
In the project's directory: 
```
npm install --save
```

# Creating ENV variables

As the Gmail API Implementation was done, it'll be required to get some secret credentials.

Find the env-credentials document at the team's project carpet.
Create a .env file in the root of the project and copy-paste these credentials.


# Run the project

As we are using nodemon, we'll be using the following command
```
npm run dev
```
